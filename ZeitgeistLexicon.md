## [It Pays to Have Word Ability](http://www.achewood.com/honorclub/zine1_24pages_stitched.pdf)

* **demasticated** (*adj*) Left uneaten.
    - "Don't let that s** go off demasticated, chew it up and have it as a meal, god dammit! I paid six dollars for that f**ing veggie gyro that you bitched about wanting in the car all day and I thought I was doing you a FAVOR to surprise you with it."

* **defenestrate** \dee-FEN-uh-strayt\ (*transitive verb*) To throw out of a window.

* **dunkus bolunkus** (*noun*) Nonsense, with a negative connotation.
    - "Do not draw a mustache and glasses above your belly button and have it say Guido Sarducci lines, that is dunkus bolunkus and you know I got to finish this Excel work by five. Cut it out. Dogg stop acting like it can smoke."

* **grelicious** (*adj*) Used to described food that is so pleasing to the mouth and senses that when you sink your teeth into it, the food consumes you. Often applied to pastrami sandwiches with everything, on soft sliced rye bread, the bread so soft yet holding the moistures of the ingredients inside; the mayo and vinegary pickles and spicy onions spread across the inside of your mouth as the soft tender meat melts into your saliva and becomes your blood and your brain.

* **jilapidated** (*adj*) Used to describe something that is in terrible condition, like a car where the hood will only get within 3" of closing and one of the windows is made out of semi-clear plastic sheeting and duct tape because some junkie needed the tape deck. Etymology: from dilapidated, but the "d" broke off, and all you could afford at the time was a funky old "j," probably in the wrong font.

* **saxa'd** (*adj*) The condition of going into an enormous record store and all of a sudden not being able to think of a single band that you like.
    - "Dogg remember if you are ever saxa'd, just work backwards from the Traveling Wilburys."

* **zabbly** (*adj*) A way of describing a piece of something that looks like it is going to fall off of the main thing.
    - "Dude please don't carry that sandwich over here with that one zabbly green olive perched on top it is giving me squirts of acid in the belly I am so tense it will fall." also "The cross on the top of the church was all zabbly after the hurricane."
