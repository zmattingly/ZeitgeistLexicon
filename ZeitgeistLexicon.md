* **demasticated** (*adj*) Left uneaten.

* **grelicious** (*adj*) Used to described food that is so pleasing to the mouth and senses that when you sink your teeth into it, the food consumes you. Often applied to pastrami sandwiches with everything, on soft sliced rye bread, the bread so soft yet holding the moistures of the ingredients inside; the mayo and vinegary pickles and spicy onions spread across the inside of your mouth as the soft tender meat melts into your saliva and becomes your blood and your brain.

* **jilapidated** (*adj*) Used to describe something that is in terrible condition, like a car where the hood will only get within 3" of closing and one of the windows is made out of semi-clear plastic sheeting and duct tape because some junkie needed the tape deck. Etymology: from dilapidated, but the "d" broke off, and all you could afford at the time was a funky old "j," probably in the wrong font.

* **saxa'd** (*adj*) The condition of going into an enormous record store and all of a sudden not being able to think of a single band that you like.
    - "Dogg remember if you are ever saxa'd, just work backwards from the Traveling Wilburys."

    - "Dude please don't carry that sandwich over here with that one zabbly green olive perched on top it is giving me squirts of acid in the belly I am so tense it will fall." also "The cross on the top of the church was all zabbly after the hurricane."
